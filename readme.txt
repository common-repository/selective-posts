Display posts with category exclusions; select number of posts, post status, and post order.

== Description ==

This Plugin allows you to show selective Posts in the sidebar or footer through a widget, just like the "Recent Posts" widget that WordPress provides. Selective Posts allows you to choose the maximum number of posts to show, and the ability to exlude posts from a category...

...and now the ability to show posts of a specific status (like future posts or drafts to indicate "upcoming posts") and ordering of these posts in ascending or descending order!
